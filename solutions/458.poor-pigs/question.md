<p>There are 1000 buckets, one and only one of them contains poison, the rest are filled with water. They all look the same. If a pig drinks that poison it will die within 15 minutes. What is the minimum amount of pigs you need to figure out which bucket contains the poison within one hour.</p>

<p>Answer this question, and write an algorithm for the follow-up general case.</p>

<p><b>Follow-up: </b></p>

<p>If there are n buckets and a pig drinking poison will die within m minutes, how many pigs (x) you need to figure out the &quot;poison&quot; bucket within p minutes? There is exact one bucket with poison.</p>
